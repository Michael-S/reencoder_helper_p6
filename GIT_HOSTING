GitHub offers many features and has become the default place people
share and search for source code. But centralizing everything in
one location is risky.

I am making a practice of dual-hosting my projects.
There are more comprehensive guides for dual-hosting a git project
on the web, but this is a quick overview of the steps:
1. Create the project on one site, like GitHub, and
clone it to your machine.
git clone git@some.server.somewhere:someuser/someproject.git
2. Create an empty project on another site, like Gitlab,
Sourcehut, Kallithea, Phacility, Gogs, Gitea, or similar.
Get the git clone URL for that project, typically something
git clone git@some.other.server.somewhere.else:someotheruser/someproject.git
In your shell prompt for the project for the previous step, enter
git remote add alternate git@some.other.server.somewhere.else:someotheruser/someproject.git

Now every time you make a change or download a change, you can do
git push # to push your changes to the first server
git push alternate # to push your changes to the other server.

For this project my two servers are:
https://github.com/Michael-S/reencoder_helper_p6
and
https://git.sr.ht/~mikeswierczek/simple_reencoder_helper
